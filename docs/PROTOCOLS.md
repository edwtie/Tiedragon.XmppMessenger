## Further XMPP RFCs

| Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| RFC 3920 | Historic XMPP Core predecessor, obsoleted by RFC 6120. |
| RFC 3921 | Historic IM and presence predecessor, obsoleted by RFC 6121. |
| RFC 6122 | Historic XMPP address format, obsoleted by RFC 7622. |

| RFC 3922 | Mapping XMPP to Common Presence and Instant Messaging, historic interoperability reference. |
| RFC 3923 | End-to-end signing and object encryption predecessor, obsoleted by RFC 6123. |

Initial implementation status:

- `XmppAddress` parses bare and full JIDs.
- `XmppConnectionSettings` keeps account, host, port and TLS requirements.
- `XmppStreamOptions` keeps client resource, language and timing defaults.
- `XmppStreamHeader`, `XmppStreamFeatureSet`, `XmppStartTls`,
  `XmppSaslPlain`, `XmppResourceBinding` and `XmppStreamNegotiationPlan`
  now cover the first RFC 6120 stream negotiation building blocks.
- `XmppFeatureSet` models support for roster, presence, stream management and
  real-time text.
- `XmppChatMessage`, `XmppPresence` and `XmppIq` serialize the first
  RFC 6120/6121 stanzas used by Alpha 1.
- The same stanza models parse incoming chat messages, presence updates and
  roster IQ results back into typed objects.

## Chat

| XEP | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| XEP-0030 | Service discovery. |
| XEP-0077 | In-band account registration, password change and account removal. |
| XEP-0115 | Entity capabilities in presence broadcasts. |
| XEP-0045 | Multi-user chat. |
| XEP-0085 | Chat state notifications such as typing. |
| XEP-0184 | Message delivery receipts. |
| XEP-0198 | Stream management and reconnect support. |
| XEP-0280 | Message carbons for multi-device sync. |
| XEP-0313 | Message archive management. |
| XEP-0352 | Client state indication. |
| XEP-0363 | HTTP file upload. |

## XEP-0045 Multi-User Chat

Teletyptel implements the MUC client helper layer in separable pieces:

1. Discover available rooms from a conference service with XEP-0030 `disco#items`.
2. Discover room occupants/items with `disco#items` on the room JID.
3. Join and leave rooms with MUC presence.
4. Send and parse `groupchat` messages.
5. Request, parse, submit or cancel owner room-configuration data forms.
6. Request or set admin items for affiliation and role flows such as member lists, bans and kicks.

The local XMPP server returns sample room discovery, room items, configuration form and admin list responses for smoke testing. Real Prosody/ejabberd interoperability is tracked separately because permission models and enabled modules differ per deployment.

## XEP-0363 HTTP File Upload

Teletyptel implements the client side in the same sequence as the standard:

1. Discover an upload service through XEP-0030.
2. Read an optional XEP-0128 data form with `FORM_TYPE=urn:xmpp:http:upload:0` and `max-file-size` in bytes.
3. Send an IQ-get slot request with `filename`, `size` and optional `content-type`.
4. Parse an HTTPS PUT URL and HTTPS GET URL from the slot result.
5. Upload bytes through HTTP PUT with exact `Content-Length`, `Content-Type` and only the allowed headers `Authorization`, `Cookie` and `Expires`.
6. Send the GET URL to the recipient as a normal message body plus a `jabber:x:oob` URL payload for clients that understand out-of-band links.

The local XMPP server advertises `urn:xmpp:http:upload:0`, reports `max-file-size` through the discovery data form and returns slot responses for smoke testing. The local PHP upload endpoint remains a browser demo path; real XMPP file upload should use the XEP-0363 slot and PUT flow.

## XEP-0245 `/me` Command

`XmppMeCommand` keeps the XEP-0245 behavior intentionally simple: `/me ` is
sent unchanged in the normal message body, and receiving clients detect that
prefix for action-style presentation.

## Legacy Smiley Codes

`LegacySmileyCatalog` recognizes classic forum smiley text codes such as `:)`,
`:P`, `8)7` and `_o_`. It returns typed text/smiley tokens with the legacy GIF
file name, so clients can render compatible images or fallback text without
changing the message body.

## XEP-0054 vcard-temp

`XmppVCardTemp` supports the vcard-temp profile fields most useful for contact
identity in early clients: formatted name, nickname, URL, birthday and photo.
It can create IQ get/set payloads and parse IQ result payloads.

## XEP-0077 In-Band Registration

`XmppInBandRegistration` creates registration info, submit, password-change and
remove IQ payloads for the `jabber:iq:register` namespace. It also parses the
legacy field-based info result used by many servers.

`XmppStreamFeatureSet.InBandRegistrationOffered` detects the optional
`http://jabber.org/features/iq-register` stream feature. `XmppStreamClient`
exposes helpers for authenticated password changes/removal and for registration
info/submit flows when the caller has opened the appropriate stream.

Public servers often rate-limit or reject automated registration. The project
treats that as correct server behavior, not a failure to bypass.

## XEP-0357 Push Notifications

`XmppPushNotifications` creates the XMPP enable/disable IQ payloads for push
services, including optional publish-options data forms. Mobile platform
registration and real provider integration remain app-layer work.

## Real-Time Text

| XEP | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| XEP-0301 | In-band real-time text. |

Real-time text is different from typing notifications. XEP-0085 says that someone is typing. XEP-0301 sends live text edits while the message is being written.

Initial implementation status:

- `RttPacket` parses and serializes `<rtt/>` packets.
- `RttMessageState` applies insert/erase actions to the visible live text buffer.
- `seq` is treated as synchronization protection; out-of-order edits are ignored until a new/reset packet arrives.
- Unicode positions are handled as code points, matching the XEP wording.
- `RttJsonEnvelope` wraps RTT XML for local WebSocket demos without replacing the XMPP payload.

## PHP WebSocket Transport

The `php/rtt-websocket-server.php` relay is a local experiment transport for RTT
messages. It sends JSON envelopes containing XEP-0301 XML between browser
windows:

```json
{
  "type": "rtt",
  "text": "Hello",
  "xml": "<rtt xmlns=\"urn:xmpp:rtt:0\" event=\"reset\" seq=\"0\"><t p=\"0\">Hello</t></rtt>"
}
```

This does not replace XMPP. It only gives the project a quick browser-visible
way to test live text behavior before a real XMPP connection is implemented.

For demo robustness the JSON envelope also carries `text` as a current snapshot.
If a demo client joins after the sender already started typing and therefore
misses the first RTT `reset`, it can show the snapshot and continue from the
next reset/edit sequence. Real XMPP clients should still follow XEP-0301 stream
synchronization rules.

The `AiBotConsole` sample is just another WebSocket client. It receives the same
JSON envelope as the WinForms demo, reconstructs live text with `RttMessageState`
and sends bot replies with `RttComposer`. This makes the bot a normal RTT
participant instead of a special server-side feature.

The same PHP relay also supports RFC 7395 test mode. When a client requests the
`xmpp` WebSocket subprotocol, the relay responds with that subprotocol, accepts
RFC 7395 `<open/>` and `<close/>` frames and relays `<message/>`, `<presence/>`
and `<iq/>` XML frames to other RFC 7395 clients.

Detailed PHP relay notes: [RTT_RELAY.md](RTT_RELAY.md).

## RFC 7395 WebSocket XMPP

RFC 7395 is separate from the demo relay. It transports normal XMPP stream XML
inside WebSocket text messages and uses the `xmpp` WebSocket subprotocol.

Current implementation status:

- `XmppWebSocketFrame` creates and parses RFC 7395 `<open/>` frames.
- `XmppWebSocketFrame.CreateClose()` creates the RFC 7395 `<close/>` frame.
- `IXmppWebSocketTransport` defines a transport boundary.
- `XmppClientWebSocketTransport` wraps `ClientWebSocket` and requests the
  `xmpp` subprotocol.
- `XmppWebSocketStream` sends open, stanza and close XML over the transport.

The PHP relay is a local RFC 7395 transport harness, not a full XMPP server. It
does not implement accounts, SASL, roster, presence storage, archive behavior or
federation.

## XEP-0156 Alternative Connection Discovery

`XmppAlternativeConnectionDiscovery` creates HTTPS host-meta URLs and parses
XML XRD and optional JSON JRD records for BOSH and RFC 7395 WebSocket endpoints.
This lets the client discover `wss://` XMPP WebSocket URLs without hardcoding
server paths.

## Localization

The WinForms demo loads UI text from `.lng` key-value files. This keeps labels,
buttons, placeholders and status messages independent from the application code
while the protocol and UI layers are still changing quickly.

The demo also supports LngPdk `.lngpdk` packages through the independent
`Tiedragon.LngPdk` library. A package contains `manifest.json` plus
`language/<code>.lng` and is compiled with `Tiedragon.LngPdk.Tool`. Loose
`.lng` files remain a development fallback.

## Encryption

| XEP | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| XEP-0384 | OMEMO end-to-end encryption. |
| XEP-0454 | OMEMO media sharing. |

## Audio And Video

| XEP | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| XEP-0166 | Jingle session signaling. |
| XEP-0167 | Jingle RTP sessions for audio/video. |
| XEP-0176 | Jingle ICE-UDP transport. |
| XEP-0320 | DTLS-SRTP fingerprints for secure media setup. |
| XEP-0177 | Jingle raw UDP transport. |
| XEP-0343 | WebRTC data channels in Jingle. |

Current core support covers Jingle `session-initiate`, `session-accept`,
`session-terminate`, `transport-info`, RTP payload descriptions, ICE-UDP
candidates, DTLS-SRTP fingerprints and RTP `session-info` states such as
ringing, hold and mute. The web client also has a local relay call bridge that
uses Jingle-shaped envelopes for offer/answer/candidate exchange and WebRTC for
browser audio/video media. Real federated interop with existing Jingle clients
still requires a server-backed smoke test.
