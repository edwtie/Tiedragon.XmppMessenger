# Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks protocol and product progress. Use `[x]` only when the
item is implemented, tested and documented.

## Scope And Claim Boundaries

- [x] README explains the current Alpha 2 evaluation scope.
- [x] README separates working protocol/client pieces from production hosting
  and public-service claims.
- [x] `Tiedragon.XmppMessenger.LocalServer` is documented as a real local C2S
  test server for localhost/protected lab use, not internet-facing production
  hosting.
- [x] Production server direction is documented as Prosody/ejabberd plus coturn,
  HTTP upload, MAM and PubSub/PEP modules.
- [x] XSF software-directory notes say not to resubmit until a usable release,
  user-facing docs and public evaluation path are complete.
- [x] XEP-0479 compliance notes separate repository evidence from formal
  compliance claims.
- [ ] Public hosted Teletyptel service is live with production account,
  abuse/rate-limit, moderation and backup policies.

## Alpha 2 - Web, Accounts And Localization

- [x] Teletyptel architecture diagram linked from the README.
- [x] XMPP core, RFC 7395 and XEP extensions shown as separate architecture layers.
- [x] Web client light/dark theme switch.
- [x] Web client local file upload endpoint and attachment rendering.
- [x] Web client account profile controls for JID, display name, peer, password option and language.
- [x] Local browser profile fallback for account settings.
- [x] PHP account API for loading and saving account profiles.
- [x] MySQL/MariaDB schema for account profiles.
- [x] WAMP/MySQL local setup documented.
- [x] Account API smoke-tested against local MariaDB.
- [x] Web `.lng` loader with English and Dutch language files.

- [ ] LngPdk package serving and verification in the web/mobile clients.
- [ ] Language key completeness validator for web `.lng` and packaged LngPdk resources.

- [ ] Password handling hardening; current local profile password option is a prototype setting.
- [x] Real XMPP server two-account chat smoke test.
- [x] Location and NG112 protocol direction recorded: XEP-0080 for XMPP user
  location and PIDF-LO/RFC 6442 for future emergency gateway interop.
- [x] ProtoXEP Jingle synchronized RTT implemented in the web client as a
  co-session WebRTC datachannel with XEP-0301 relay fallback.
- [x] `rtt` datachannel listens for raw UTF-8 T.140 payloads and applies
  backspace/delete plus CR/LF as live call text.
- [x] Browser sends linear live edits as raw T.140 over the negotiated `rtt`
  datachannel and keeps the JSON wrapper for reset/final/non-linear metadata.
- [x] Core RFC 4103 direction started: T.140 codec, RTP v2 packet parser,
  `text/t140` packetizer and RFC 2198 `text/red` redundant payload helper.
- [x] ProtoXEP Jingle synchronized RTT Playwright retest passed with two fresh
  browser profiles: video call connected, `rtt` datachannel opened,
  `jingle-rtt-out`/`jingle-rtt-in` logged, live draft displayed and final
  `jingle-rtt` message delivered.
- [ ] Roster/contact model backed by XMPP instead of local demo state.
- [ ] Replace demo relay semantics with standards-based XMPP production routing.
- [ ] Mobile WebView packaging smoke test for Android and iOS.
