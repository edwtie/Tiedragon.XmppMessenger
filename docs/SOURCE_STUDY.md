# Source Study

This document lists open-source XMPP projects worth studying before implementing Tiedragon XMPP Messenger.

The goal is not to copy code. The goal is to understand architecture, protocol flow, edge cases and user experience decisions.

## Best Source Repositories To Study

| Project | Source | Stack | Study value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gajim | https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim and mirror https://github.com/gajim/gajim | Python, GTK, nbxmpp | Best desktop reference for broad XMPP feature coverage, Windows/Linux/macOS packaging and account/session architecture. |
| python-nbxmpp | https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp | Python | XMPP protocol library used by Gajim; useful to understand stanza handling, stream management, MAM, MUC and discovery. |
| Conversations | https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations and GitHub mirrors | Android, Java/Kotlin | Strong reference for mobile XMPP, OMEMO, message carbons, file upload and practical Jingle/audio-video behavior. |
| Dino | https://github.com/dino/dino | Vala, GTK | Modern desktop UX, OMEMO, MUC, file upload and Jingle direction. Useful for UI/product decisions. |
| Monal | https://github.com/monal-im/Monal | Objective-C/Swift, iOS/macOS | Good Apple-platform reference for mobile behavior, push expectations, calls and account UX. |
| Converse.js | https://github.com/conversejs/converse.js | JavaScript | Browser/web XMPP, WebSocket/BOSH, plugin architecture and embeddable chat UI. |
| Movim | https://github.com/movim/movim | PHP/Web | Self-hosted web XMPP/social client, useful for deployment and server-side web integration ideas. |
| xmpp.js | https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js | JavaScript | Lightweight XMPP client/library architecture. Useful if we later test WebView or TypeScript prototypes. |
| Smack | https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack | Java | Mature XMPP library with many XEP implementations; useful for understanding protocol APIs and test patterns. |
| Strophe.js | https://github.com/strophe/strophejs | JavaScript | Classic browser XMPP library for BOSH/WebSocket. Useful for web transport ideas. |

## First Things To Inspect

### Connection And Session

- account model
- TLS/SASL login
- resource binding
- reconnect behavior
- XEP-0198 stream management
- error states shown to the user

Best references:

- Gajim
- python-nbxmpp
- Conversations
- Smack

### Chat And History

- message object model
- local message database
- delivery receipts
- message carbons
- MAM synchronization
- duplicate message prevention

Best references:

- Gajim
- Conversations
- Dino
- Converse.js

### Real-Time Text

- XEP-0301 support status
- how live edits are represented in the UI
- fallback when the other client does not support RTT
- interaction with normal message send

Best references:

- XMPP XEP-0301 specification first
- then search client sources for `urn:xmpp:rtt:0`, `rtt`, `t`, `e`, `w`, `p`, `c`

### Audio And Video

- Jingle invite/accept/reject/hangup flow
- ICE candidate exchange
- STUN/TURN configuration
- WebRTC integration boundary
- call state UI

Best references:

- Conversations
- Dino
- Monal
- XEP-0166, XEP-0167 and XEP-0176

### Security

- credential storage
- OMEMO device list handling
- trust/fingerprint UI
- encrypted file sharing

Best references:

- Conversations
- Gajim
- Dino
- Monal

## Recommended Study Order

1. Gajim and python-nbxmpp for desktop XMPP architecture.
2. Conversations for practical modern XMPP features and call behavior.
3. Dino for modern desktop UI choices.
4. Converse.js for web/XMPP-over-WebSocket patterns.
5. Monal for mobile/call edge cases.

## Early Technical Direction For Our Project

For a Windows-first .NET app, avoid copying another client's full stack. Instead:

- use a clean internal domain model for accounts, conversations, messages and calls
- put XMPP protocol handling behind an `IXmppClient` boundary
- keep RTT as a first-class message stream, not a small typing-indicator add-on
- prototype calls separately because Jingle/WebRTC is complex
- choose a mature .NET XMPP library only after checking XEP coverage and maintenance state

## Search Terms

Use these when inspecting source:

```text
urn:xmpp:rtt:0
XEP-0301
urn:xmpp:jingle:1
urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:rtp
urn:xmpp:jingle:transports:ice-udp
urn:xmpp:mam
urn:xmpp:carbons
urn:xmpp:receipts
urn:xmpp:omemo
```
