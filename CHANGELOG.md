### Known Limits

- The hosted public demo is not live yet; Alpha 1 is evaluated locally.
- The PHP relay is a development bridge, not a production XMPP server.
- The web UI does not yet log into arbitrary production XMPP servers directly.
- End-to-end encryption, group chat, file upload and calls are roadmap items.
